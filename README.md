# Palindrome Checker with JavaScript

Palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. There are also numeric palindromes, including date/time stamps using short digits 11/11/11 11:11 and long digits 02/02/2020. (Source from Wikipedia)

This Palindrome Checker will return true if the parameter is palindrom word and will return false if the parameter isn't palindrome word.
